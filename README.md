This repository features a dynamic Interactive Sales & Business Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel. This project demonstrates the power of Excel for data storytelling, utilizing advanced features like PivotTables, Slicers, and VBA macros to create a professional-grade business intelligence tool.

# 🚀 Project Overview
